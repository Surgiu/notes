# can i add functions in structs?
Yes, you can definitely add functions inside structs in C++. This is known as member functions or methods. Member functions can access and manipulate the data members of the struct.

Here's an example of a struct with member functions:

```cpp
struct Rectangle {
    double length;
    double width;

    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }

    double perimeter() {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }
};
```

In this example, the `Rectangle` struct has two data members: `length` and `width`. It also has two member functions: `area()` and `perimeter()`. These functions calculate and return the area and perimeter of the rectangle, respectively.

You can create an instance of the `Rectangle` struct and call its member functions like this:

```cpp
Rectangle rect;
rect.length = 5.0;
rect.width = 3.0;

double area = rect.area();
double perimeter = rect.perimeter();

cout << "Area: " << area << endl;
cout << "Perimeter: " << perimeter << endl;
```

Output:
```
Area: 15
Perimeter: 16
```

Adding functions to structs allows you to encapsulate related functionality within the struct itself. It promotes code organization and makes the struct more self-contained.

Just like with data members, the default access specifier for member functions in a struct is `public`. If you want to make a member function `private` or `protected`, you can do so by using the respective access specifiers.

```cpp
struct MyStruct {
public:
    void publicFunction() {
        // Public member function
    }

private:
    void privateFunction() {
        // Private member function
    }
};
```

In this case, `publicFunction()` can be accessed from outside the struct, while `privateFunction()` can only be accessed from within the struct or its member functions.

Using member functions in structs allows you to define behavior and operations associated with the struct, making the struct more expressive and functional.
