# what does dynamic memory allocation mean

Dynamic memory allocation in C++ refers to the process of allocating memory for variables and objects at runtime, rather than at compile time. This means that the amount of memory allocated for a variable or object can be determined at runtime based on user input or other factors.

Dynamic memory allocation is typically used when the amount of memory needed for a program is not known at compile time, or when the amount of memory needed is too large to be allocated on the stack. Dynamic memory allocation is performed using the `new` and `delete` operators in C++.

Here's an example of dynamic memory allocation:
```csharp
int* p = new int;
*p = 42;
std::cout << *p << std::endl;  // Output: 42
delete p;
```
In this example, the `new` operator is used to allocate memory for an integer variable on the heap. The address of the variable is stored in a pointer variable `p`. The value `42` is then assigned to the variable using the dereference operator (`*`), and the value is printed to the console using `std::cout`. Finally, the memory allocated for the variable is released using the `delete` operator.

Dynamic memory allocation can also be used to allocate memory for arrays and objects. For example:
```csharp
int n;
std::cin >> n;
int* arr = new int[n];
// Use the array...
delete[] arr;
```
In this example, the user is prompted to enter the size of an array, and the `new` operator is used to allocate memory for an array of that size on the heap. The address of the array is stored in a pointer variable `arr`. After using the array, the memory allocated for the array is released using the `delete[]` operator.

Dynamic memory allocation can be a powerful tool for creating flexible and efficient programs, but it also requires careful management of memory to avoid memory leaks and other errors. It's important to always release memory allocated with `new` using `delete`, and to avoid using dangling pointers or accessing memory that has already been released.
