## Performance specifications in the frequency domain
### Specifications
- Resonant frequency $\omega_r$ and the maximum value $M_{p\omega}$
- Bandwidth $\omega_B$
### Relationships to time domain
- As the **resonant peak** $M_{p\omega}$ increases in magnitude, the **percent overshoot** $\sigma$ to a step input increases
- As the **bandwidth** $\omega_B$ increases, the **rise time** $t_r$ of the step response of the system will decrease
- For second-order systems, the greater the magnitude of $\omega_n$ when $\zeta$ is constant, the more rapidly the response approaches the desired steady-state value.
