# how to overload an operator in C++

## Operator overloading is a feature of C++ that allows you to define the behavior of built-in operators (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, etc.) when they are used with user-defined types. Here's how to overload an operator in C++:

1. Choose the operator you want to overload. For example, let's say we want to overload the `+` operator for a `Complex` class that represents complex numbers.
2. Define a function with the following signature:
```csharp
return_type operator+(const Complex& other) const;
```
The function should take a single parameter of the same type as the class (in this case, `Complex`), and should return a value of the same type as well. The `const` keyword indicates that the function does not modify the object it is called on.

3. Implement the function to define the behavior of the `+` operator. In this case, we want to add the real and imaginary parts of two `Complex` numbers:
```csharp
Complex Complex::operator+(const Complex& other) const {
    return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
}
```
This function creates a new `Complex` object with the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the two input objects.

4. Use the overloaded operator in your code. For example:
```scss
Complex a(1, 2);
Complex b(3, 4);
Complex c = a + b;
```
This code creates two `Complex` objects, `a` and `b`, and then adds them using the overloaded `+` operator. The result is stored in a new `Complex` object, `c`.

## Here's the complete code for the `Complex` class with the overloaded `+` operator:
```csharp
class Complex {
public:
    Complex(double r = 0.0, double i = 0.0) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload the + operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }

private:
    double real;
    double imag;
};
```
You can overload other operators in a similar way. The syntax and semantics of operator overloading depend on the specific operator you are overloading.
